Q1: Hackerearth Solution to find out minimum number from an array/.

def FindIt (arr):
    # Write your code here

    min = arr[0] #Any value at position 0 will be assigned as min.

    for i in arr:   #Will iterate for loop through arr to finout minimum value
        if i < min: #Here will check if the element is less than min or not
            min = i #if it is less than min then we will assign it to min 
    pass
    return min #after all the iteration will return the element which is the minimum element
    
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
 
out_ = FindIt(arr)
print (out_)
